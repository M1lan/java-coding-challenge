## Problem statement formulation

Dear [REDACTED] and dear Reviewers from [REDACTED],

as per original Problem statement:

> I am creating a "Spring Boot application that demonstrates my expertise in modern Java Spring Boot development; time-boxed in 3 hours".


## Thingk
The application integrates data from multiple APIs asynchronously,
featuring a REST endpoint and CLI interface.  I will implement it using
Spring Boot, add Project Reactor for reactive programming, and also add
Spring WebClient for HTTP communications.  Key technical highlights
include asynchronous data processing, caching, and comprehensive error
handling.  The project showcases my experience with:

- Java/Spring Boot ecosystem
- Reactive programming
- RESTful API design
- Caching (built-into Spring Boot)
- Test-driven development

I'd be happy to discuss this project in more detail during an interview.
Best of regards,

Milan Santosi
